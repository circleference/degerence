Degerence is the first released virus i made, that's all i can say

# Description
WARNING: This virus does not damage your PC, It only damages unsaved data.
Each 10 seconds there is a new stage, There are 4 stages. In the first stage, music will play and you can see a message box saying "Cut off a hydras head, 2 will take its place", If you click it, 2 same message boxes will appear
In the second stage, you can see a message saying "Cut off a megahydras head, 4 will take its place", this is the same, except it will replicate itself 4 times unlike the 1st stage, which replicates itself 2 times
In the third stage, there is no turning back. you cannot close the virus. Why? It spams 5 flashing command windows, making the PC nearly unusable. In the 4th stage, it terminates everything except the flashing command windows, It creates 15 more flashing command windows. It also changes the music and makes a message box saying "Cut off a gigahydras head, 8 will take its place" which replicates itself 8 times when you close it. The music also is infinite
The only way to stop it is to go to command prompt, type in taskkill /f /im cscript.exe, taskkill /f /im wscript.exe and taskkill /f /im cmd.exe, make sure to type taskkill /f /im cmd.exe after you terminated cscript.exe and wscript.exe, You can only stop it before the 3rd stage

(i realized that you can just spam alt+f4 at the 3rd stage to terminate the spammers lol)
